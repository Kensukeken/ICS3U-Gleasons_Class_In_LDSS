## While Loops
While-loops allow us to repeat code while a certain condition is true. If the conditon is met, the loop will exit. <br/>
```bash
while(condition){
	//execute some code over and over
}
```
We use the same condition comparision operators as if we were making if-statement conditions: `< > <= >= == !=` or using text comparisons.
