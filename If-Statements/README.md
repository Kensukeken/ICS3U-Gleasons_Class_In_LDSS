## If-Statements
The if-statement allows a computer to make a decision.

Is it hot outside?
Has the spaceship reached the edge of the screen?
Has too much money been withdrawn from the account?
If-statements are formatted like so:
```bash
if(condition){
	//execute this code
} 
```
<br/>


To check a condition, we can compare numbers (literal numbers or variables) using `<`, `<=`,`>`,`>=`,`==`,`!=`.

If the condition is true, the code inside the curly brackets will execute. If the condition is false, the code inside the curly brackets will be completely skipped over.
