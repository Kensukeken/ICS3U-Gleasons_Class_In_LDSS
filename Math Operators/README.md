## Arithmetic Operators
Computers are incredible at doing calculations. Now that we have declared variables, letâ€™s use them with arithmetic operators to calculate things.

Here are the arithmetic operators:

`+` addition

`-` subtraction

`*` multiplication

`/` division

`%` modulo (divides and gives the remainder)

## Order of Operations
Expressions with more than one operator will follow BEDMAS. If you want certain calculations performed first, use brackets.

`answer = 4 - 5 * 2 + 3;` has a result of -3, whereas `answer = (4 - 5) * (2 + 3);` has a result of -5.
