## Hello World!
Take a look at the hello.cpp file in the code editor that is placed in the middle of the screen. It’s a C++ program!

In our code editor, the file name is displayed at the top and along the left side. C++ programs are stored in files which usually have the file extension .cpp, which simply stands for “C Plus Plus”.

The code inside our C++ file is a classic first step all new programmers take — they greet the world through the console!

The console is the panel on the right and will show the output of our program.

## Output
C++, like most programming languages, runs line by line, from top to bottom. Here is the structure of a C++ program: <br/>

In between the curly brackets is what we are going to focus on for now.

## Output Function & Punctuation

`std::cout` is the character output stream. It is pronounced “c-out”.

<< is an operator that comes right after it.

"Hello World!" is what’s being outputted here. You need double quotes around literal text.

`;` is a punctuation that tells the computer that you are at the end of a statement. It is similar to a period in a sentence. Almost every line we type will have one of these after it.

`\n` is a new line character. It moves the cursor to the next line.
Comments


## Comments
`//This is a comment!` <br/>
``/*This is a multi-
line comment!*/``<br/>
The computer ignores comments. We use comments to keep code organized, leave notes for ourselves, or leave notes for other programmers.

## Tasks
1. Add comments to our code.
2. Output lines of our own on separate lines.
3. Create the following pattern: <br/>
