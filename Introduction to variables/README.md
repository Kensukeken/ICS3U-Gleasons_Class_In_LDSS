## Introduction to Variables
The "Hello World!" program simply writes to the screen. It does not read anything, calculate anything, or allow for user input. That’s no fun!

Real programs tend to produce results based on some input that the user of the program gives, rather than just outputting the same thing every time.

To read something from the keyboard, we first need somewhere in the computer’s memory to store data. That is where variables come in.

A variable is simply a name that represents a particular piece of your computer’s memory that has been set aside for you to store, retrieve, and use data.

Think of it like a storage container.
