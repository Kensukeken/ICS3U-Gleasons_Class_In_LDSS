My assignment here (Using "int"):
[Make a Primitive Calculator.cpp](https://github.com/Kensukeken/ICS3U-Gleasons_Class_In_LDSS/blob/main/Primitive%20Calculator/Make%20a%20Primitive%20Calculator.cpp) <br />
I also made another one but using "double" and that's still works:
[calc_using_double.cpp](https://github.com/Kensukeken/ICS3U-Gleasons_Class_In_LDSS/blob/main/Primitive%20Calculator/calc_using_double.cpp)
